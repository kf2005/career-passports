        <div class="story-text">
          <p>NextStep Navigator was founded by Our team <strong>Bitstrom</strong> in 2012 with a vision of providing life-transforming learning experiences to learners around the world.
             Today, NextStep Navigator is a global platform for online learning and career development that offers anyone, anywhere, access to online courses and degrees from leading universities 
             and companies. NextStep Navigator  became a Delaware public benefit corporation in February 2021, which means that we have a legal duty not only to our shareholders, 
             but to also make a positive impact on society more broadly, as we continue our efforts to reduce barriers to world-class education for all. 
             We also received B Corp certification in February 2021, indicating that NextStep Navigator meets rigorous standards of social and environmental performance,
              accountability, and transparency.</p><br><br>
               <p><strong>175+ million learners and more than 6,200 campuses, businesses, and governments</strong> 
                have come to NextStep Navigator to access world-class learning—anytime, anywhere.</p>
